# ALgorithmic Trading

This is an ongoing project. Here, me with my teammates, are trying to develop a profitable trading strategy. We will be backtesting this strategy on Indian market data from Yahoo Finance. Once completion, we can incorporate this into our DEMAT account and then the trades will take place automatically.

## Features

- Developed a Python-based Pair trading algorithm, to identify and trade pair of similar stocks in a market neutral strategy
- Backtested the algorithm on Indian financial market, using real-time stock cases, with average profit margin of 4-6%
- Scrutinized trading systems like mean reversion, delta hedging, volatility based calendar spread & momentum portfolios
- Analysed a statistical arbitrage strategy using ARMA and backtested the Cointegration approach to optimize alphas
